A Mastermind game to exercise with OOP. From the Odin Project.

<h3> Assignment </h3>
Build a Mastermind game from the command line where you have 12 turns to guess the secret code, starting with you guessing the computerâ€™s random code.

<h3> Game Description </h3>
Mastermind is a code-breaking game for two players.
One player is the Codemaker and the other the Codebreaker:
-the Codemaker chooses a pattern of four code pegs between six colors which will be the master code.
-the Codebreaker tries to guess the pattern in both order and color within 12 rounds using the hints provided after each guess.

If the Codebreaker guesses the master code he wins, if the codebreaker can't find it in 12 rounds the Codemakers wins.
