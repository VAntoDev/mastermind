<h3> Assignment </h3>
Build a Mastermind game from the command line where you have 12 turns to guess the secret code, starting with you guessing the computerâ€™s random code.

<h3> Game Description </h3>
Mastermind is a code-breaking game for two players.
One player is the <b>Codemaker</b> and the other the <b>Codebreaker</b> :

-The <b>Codemaker</b> chooses a pattern of four code pegs between six colors which will be the master code.

-The <b>Codebreaker</b> tries to guess the pattern in both order and color within 12 rounds using the hints provided after each guess.

If the <b>Codebreaker</b> guesses the master code they win, if the <b>Codebreaker</b> can't find it in 12 rounds the <b>Codemaker</b> wins.
